1)  
i. $\prec$ is both irreflexive and transitive

Proof 1: If x $\succ$ x then x $\succsim$ x but also $\neg$ x $\succsim$ x, which is simply impossible.

Proof 2: Let x $\prec$ y and y $\prec$ z and x $\neq$ z. Then x $\precsim$ y and y $\precsim$ z and thus x $\precsim$ z. Since x $\neq$ z then x $\prec$ z and transitivity has been proven.

ii. $\sim$ is reflexive, transitive and symmetric

Proof 1: Since $\succsim$ is rational, x $\succsim$ x and x $\precsim$ x which yields x $\sim$ x $\forall$x $\in$ X. 

Proof 2: Let x $\sim$ y and y $\sim$ z. Since it's known that x $\precsim$ y and y $\precsim$ z $\Rightarrow$ x $\precsim$ z and thus x $\sim$ z.

Proof 3: Let x $\sim$ y. It's known that if x $\succsim$ y and x $\precsim$ y then x $\sim$ y. Thus y $\sim$ x. 

iii. if x $\succ$ y $\succsim$ z, then x $\succ$ z. 

Proof 1: Let x $\succ$ y $\succsim$ z. Since $\succsim$ is transitive, it's known that x $\succsim$ y $\succsim$ z, but since x $\succ$ y, x $\succ$ z!

2)
i. Show that $\succsim$ is
